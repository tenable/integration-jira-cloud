# This is the configuration file for the Tenable-to-Jira integration.  This
# configuration file follows the TOML standard, which should be easier to work
# with instead of the older v1 YAML format, which had some error-prone issues
# due to indentation requirements.  The structure of this file is also a bit
# different than the v1 format, attempting to break the data down in a more
# flexible and scalable way.
#
# One of the common conventions you will see in this file is the use of:
#
# - fieldname.tsc
# - fieldname.tvm
#
# parameters within the configuration file.  Whenever you see this the field
# is split to be Tenable platform-specific.  If you need to adjust one of those
# values, be sure to adjust the one that appropriate to your platform.


### Tenable parameters
[tenable]
# Which Tenable platform will we be interfacing with?
# supported values are:
# - "tvm" for Tenable Vulnerability Manager
# - "tsc" for Tenable Security Center
platform        =

# The API Access and Secret keys for the Tenable account.
access_key      =

# The URL to connect to.  If this is for Tenable Vulnerability Manager, then
# the default of "https://cloud.tenable.com" is generally sufficient.  If this
# is for a fedramp environment or for a Tenable Security Center environment,
# then adjust this URL to point to the platform.

# If interfacing into Tenable Security Center, you can pass a query Id instead

### Jira Custom Field Declarations
# The list of field declarations maps the finding attributes to a custom field
# within Jira.  The list of field here are will appear in the assigned screen
# tabs in the same order that they have been configured within this config.
#
# Example field:
# [[jira.fields]]
# name          = "Jira Field Name"
# screen_tab    = "Screen Tab Name"
# type          = "customfield type"
# searcher      = "searcher type"
# task_types    = ["subtask", "task"]
# attr.tvm      = "tvm finding attribute"
# attr.tsc      = "tsc finding attribute"
#
# * Screen tab names are used as part of screen management within the initial
#   setup and first phase of the sync run unless manage_screens is disabled.
# * The integration supports proper formatting of a subset of the supportable
#   jira fieldtypes based on the kind of data stored within a finding in TVM or
#   TSC.  Those supported field types and searcher types are:
#
#   Field Type                Searcher Types
#  ------------------------- ---------------------------------
#  readonlyfield             textsearcher

#
# If the platform_id attribute is set to true, then the attributes on this
# field will be ignored and the platform name in the tenable section will be
# used as the field value instead.
# platform_id   = true

# be.
